# Microsoft Threat Intelligence Cleanup Tool

## Background

In our efforts to integrate Mandiant's Threat Intelligence (TI) with Microsoft Sentinel, an unforeseen error resulted in the ingestion of over 1.2 million Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) with a score of 0 into our Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. Despite reaching out for assistance, no viable solution was provided to revert and clean up these unnecessary IOCs.

## Motivation

To address this issue and prevent similar situations in the future, I developed this script to automate the process of deleting unnecessary threat intelligence indicators from Microsoft Sentinel.

## Solution

This repository contains a Go script that utilizes the Microsoft Azure API to delete threat intelligence indicators based on specific criteria. The script is designed to:

* List all threat intelligence indicators based on specified confidence levels and sources.
* Delete each indicator using the Azure API.

## Features

* **Concurrent Deletion**: Concurrent deletion of indicators using goroutines for improved performance.
* **Dynamic Configuration**: Modify the sources and confidence levels through command-line arguments.
* **Signal Handling**: Graceful shutdown on receiving a Ctrl-C signal.
* **Reusable HTTP Client**: Reusable HTTP client for efficient API calls.
* **JSON Decoder**: JSON decoder for efficient response parsing.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have the Azure CLI installed and authenticated.
2. Ensure Go is installed on your system.

### Steps

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/threat-intelligence-cleanup.git
   cd threat-intelligence-cleanup
   ```


2. **Get Azure Token**: Retrieve the Azure access token:
   ```sh
   export AZURE_TOKEN=$(az account get-access-token --query 'accessToken' --output tsv)
   ```


3. **Run Script:**: Run the script with the required parameters:
   ```sh
        go run main.go --source="Mandiant" --minConfidence=0 --maxConfidence=70
   ```
### Command-Line Arguments

-    `--source`: Specify the source of threat intelligence indicators (default: "Mandiant").
-   `--minConfidence`: Specify the minimum confidence level (default: 0).
- `--maxConfidence`: Specify the maximum confidence level (default: 70).


### Example
To delete threat intelligence indicators from the "Mandiant" source with a confidence level between 0 and 70:

```sh
    go run main.go --source="Mandiant" --minConfidence=0 --maxConfidence=70
```
